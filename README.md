This is a simple Python app that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI)! 😊 Just enter your weight (in kg) and height (in meters), and it tells you your BMI and health status (like Underweight or Normal). 🏋️‍♂️ It’s user-friendly with a nice GUI and buttons to calculate or reset. 🎉

🅰️ Easy input fields for weight and height.
📊 Shows BMI and health status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obesity).
🚀 Has a Calculate button and a Reset button.
🖼️ Clean and colorful interface using Tkinter.

🛠️ Tools Used

🐍 Python 3: The main programming language.
🖼️ Tkinter: Python’s built-in library for creating the GUI.
📩 messagebox: Tkinter module to show error messages.
💻 Command Line: To run the script.

😓 Challenges Faced

🚫 Handling wrong inputs (like letters instead of numbers) was tricky, so added error messages. 🛑
🎨 Making the GUI look nice and organized took some effort with layout and colors.
🧮 Ensuring the BMI formula and status categories were correct was important.
